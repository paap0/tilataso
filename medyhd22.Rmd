##<span style="color:purple">Abstract</span>

**Background**

Alcohol usage continues to be prevalent among youth. To implement preventive measures the sociodemographic, individual and parental factors behind problem behavior should be understood better. 

**Objective**

This study aims to firstly, describe current social, demographic and performance factors and secondly, to investigate the associations between them and high alcohol consumption using school reports and questionnaires from two Portuguese schools.

**Method**

Descriptive results are generated stratified by gender, student performance groups and high alcohol usage.A multiple correspondence analysis is used to analyze social, demographic, student and parental characteristics and high alcohol usage. 

**Results**

The result from multiple correspondence analysis shows that there is association between high alcohol usage and social and demographic features. There are individuals which  share both high frequency of high alcohol consumptions and high frequencies for one or more class failures, lowest performance with regard to final grade, no willingness to higher eduction, older age, guardian being other than mother or father and going out frequently. In addition, they share a low frequency for mother큦 and father큦 higher eduction. Surprisingly, good health status defined by the respondent him or herself was quite frequent among the group members having high alcohol usage in common.


**Conclusion**

There is an indication that some sociodemographic factors have joint effects. It is important to confirm the associations using advanced techniques, e.g. by applying theory of planned behavior to study the relations among personal beliefs, attitudes, behavioral intentions and behaviour and other individual as well as parental features to investigate the risk factors for high alcohol usage.


##<span style="color:purple">Introduction</span>


Data including grades, demographic, social and school related features were collected in two Portuguese schools using school reports and questionnaires and stored as two separate datasets regarding performance in distinct subjects, namely Mathematics and Portuguese. The original data of the analysis in this study are freely available as a [zip file](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00320/) with [metadata](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance).For the purpose of this study the datasets were joined and edited according to [this R script](https://github.com/paap0/IODS-final/blob/master/data/create_Fin_alc.R). The variables not used for joining the two data sets were combined by averaging them. Variables were further categorized to decrease the total amount of variable categories. This approach simultanously decreases the amount of information, but, on the other hand facilitates interpreation of the results. Instead of using labels for the created categories the exact ranges were used to facilitate the interpretation.
In addition, a binary *Alcohol_use* was created by using two separate five scaled (very low-very high) variables, namely alcohol use on weekdays and during weekends. A treshold value of more than low (2) was choses for the high alcohol usage *either* on weekdays *or* on weekends.Furthermore, the variables were renamed to ease and clarify the graphical display of the results.

### <span style="color:purple">Structure of the dataset</span>

Data are loaded. The final data set includes 434 respondents and 19 factorial and one supplementary, quantitative variable. The names of the variables and their explanations are listed below.

## <span style="color:purple">Descriptive results</span>

Firstly, a detailed variable summary is presented and thereafter the variables are visualized firstly by barplots stratified by gender.Finally, summary tables are created using three different strata: gender, performance group and alcohol use to capture interesting relations.


### <span style="color:purple">Overall summary</span>
 
&nbsp;

```{r fig.align="center", fig.width=10, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(settings)
reset(options)
options("scipen"=10, "digits"=2)
tab1<-CreateTableOne(vars=colnames(dfalc) ,data=dfalc,factorVars = colnames(dfalc[-19]))
summary(tab1)
reset(options)
```
&nbsp;

### <span style="color:purple">Graphical overview</span>

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=4, fig.align= "center", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#lets plot  
#density plots for numerical variables7
colNames <- names(dfalc)
for(i in colNames){
    plt<-ggplot(dfalc, aes_string(x=i)) + 
      geom_bar(aes(fill = OUT_SOW_mort_dic), position = "dodge", stat="count")+
      scale_fill_manual(values = c("green","red"))
      print(plt)
}

```
&nbsp;

There are approximately as many female as male student respondents. Under 17 year youngs are better represented than the other age groups. Suprisingly low proportion, namely only 10% of the parents live separated. Mother큦 and father큦 low educational status is common: 40% and 48%, respectively. In addition, it seems to be more common for female respondents to have a parent very little educational background.

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=4, fig.align= "center", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#lets plot  
#density plots for numerical variables7
colNames <- names(dfalc)
for(i in colNames){
    plt<-ggplot(dfalc, aes_string(x=i)) + 
      geom_bar(aes(fill = OUT_SOW_cull_dic), position = "dodge", stat="count")+
      scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue","orange"))
      print(plt)
}

```
&nbsp;

Most of the mother큦 working places are defined as "other" (36%) and father's as well (36%). Altogether 14% are stay at home mother큦 and 4% of the father큦 are at home. There are 16% of the mothers teaching and 8% of the fathers.Especially for the females the guardian is the mother, for every fourth it is, yet, the father and for 4% another person. There is family support for 62% of the students, and  it seems to be more common for females.






&nbsp;

Almost everyone, 95% has positive attitude towards higher eduction. Again, it seems even more common for females. In romantic relationship are 32% of the respondents. Females seem to be a little less active than males: altogether 47% have no extracurricular activities. Family relationships are mainly described as good or very good (76%), which is expected these data coming from a Mediterranian country with high family values. 



&nbsp;

Altogether 35% are going out frequently, 33% not often but not rarely, and 32% quite rarely. Health status is defined as very bad or bad as often as by almost every fourth respondent. Very good or good health status is very common, though (55%). A little more than every tenth student has one or more class failures whereas 87% have none. School absences are within 6 or less hours in 77% of the cases. 



&nbsp;

Performance groups represent approximately the lowest, medium low, middle high and highest groups. Very low or low alcohol consumers both at weekdays and during weekends represent 60% of the respondents.However, there seems to be an expected trend towards males drinking more.


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}

KreateTableOne = function(x, ...){
  t1 = tableone::CreateTableOne(data=x, ...)
  t2 = print(t1, quote=TRUE)
  rownames(t2) = gsub(pattern='\\"', replacement='', rownames(t2))
  colnames(t2) = gsub(pattern='\\"', replacement='', colnames(t2))
  return(t2)
}

table1 = KreateTableOne(x=dfalc, strata="OUT_SOW_mort_dic")

table2 = KreateTableOne(x=dfalc, strata="OUT_SOW_cull_dic")

#table3 = KreateTableOne(x=dfalc, strata="High_alcohol")
```







&nbsp;

### <span style="color:purple">Summary stratified by **gender**</span>
&nbsp;

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#knitr::kable(table1)
table1%>%
    kable("html", align = "rrr", caption = "Data variable summary stratified by GENDER") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("hover", "condensed")) %>% 
  scroll_box(height = "300px" )

```
&nbsp;

The before assumed trend for females having a mother with low educational level is not statistically significant. However, there are significant gender-related differences between mother큦 working place: females seem to have mothers staying at home more, whereas the proportion of mothers as teachers is twice that for males than females. Females indeed have more family support and they are almost unexeptionally willing to participate in higher eduction. Instead, males are more active. Females judge their health status less good (bordenline significant). And, finally, 31% of the females versus 50% of the males consume a lot of alcohol either during weekdays or weekends.

s)

### <span style="color:purple">Summary stratified by **final grade**</span>
&nbsp;

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#knitr::kable(table2)
table2%>%
    kable("html", align = "rrr", caption = "Data variable summary stratified by FINAL GRADE") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("hover", "condensed")) %>% 
  scroll_box(height = "300px" )

```
&nbsp;

There are differences among the age groups in final grades. Younger student get better scores. Mother큦 educational background seem to affect the grades, whereas father큦 education is not that influental. The same is seen with mother큦 and father큦 working place. Guardian does not affect school performance, but willingness to take higher education definitely does. Surprisingly, going out with friends does not affect final grades, but health status does. There are a lot of students in a very good or good condition performing below the average. Class failures understandably worsen the grades. Low alcohol usage is less common in the best performance group. 


### <span style="color:purple">Summary stratified by **alcohol consumption**</span>

&nbsp;


&nbsp;

Males drink more than females, as do the younger ones as well.Father큦 job affects alcohol consumption, but mother큦 job, student큦 guardian or family relationships seem not to. Going out is associated with alcohol usage, but health group seems not to. Class failures are more common among the heavy alcohol users, as well as the highest numbers of school absences. Mean final grade differs significantly between the groups (mean(sd)): 11.74(3.43) versus 11.06(3.04).
&nbsp;


##<span style="color:purple">Multiple correspondence analysis</span>

###<span style="color:purple">Methodology</span>

Simple form of analysing categorical data is cross-tabulation.  Correspondence analysis is an extention of contingency table data and a generalization of principal component approach. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) is an extension of correspondence analysis and allows to investigate the pattern of relationships of several categorical dependent variables simultaneously. Applying multiple correspondence analysis helps to reduce the interaction parameters. Using the results of a MCA, it is possible to describe the structure of all the categorical variables included. The computational graphical representations covers basically every bit of information in the data by mapping each variable/individual of analysis as a point in a low-dimensional space. 

To encompass, MCA has several features that distinguish it from other techniques of data analysis. It simplifies large and complex data and provides a detailed description of practically every bit of information in the data, yielding a simple, yet exhaustive scrutiny of relationships occuring by multiple pair wise comparisons. Graphically, dual displays are produced to facilitate interpretation.

Basically, the first step is that a crosstabulated frequency table is standardized to yield relative frequencies across the cells to sum up to 1.0. The aim of a MCA analysis is to represent the entries in the table of relative frequencies in terms of the distances between individual rows and/or columns in a low-dimensional space.


### <span style="color:purple">Analysis</span>

MCA() function that come in the package "FactoMineR" by Francois Husson, Julie Josse, Sebastien Le, and Jeremy Mazet. Additionally, package "factoextra" is used to beautifully visualize multiple correspondence analysis.

```{r}
dfalc<-med
res.mca = MCA(dfalc,quanti.sup=(38:39),quali.sup=(32:37), graph = FALSE)
```

There are 434 individuals and 55 variable categories. Additionally, there is one quantitative variable, which is considered illustrative.

### <span style="color:purple">Description of MCA output</span>

The output of the MCA() function is a list including :

```{r fig.align="center", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, warnings=FALSE}
res_mca <- MCA(dfalc,quanti.sup=(38:39),quali.sup=(32:37), graph = FALSE)
print(res_mca)
```

### <span style="color:purple">MCA summary</span>

For the variables a correlation ratio (squared) between it and each dimension is given (eta<sup>^2</sup>) enabling the plotting of the variables. The v-test in the summary follows a gaussian distribution referring to the category having a coordinate significantly different from zero.

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.align="center", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, warnings=FALSE}
summary(res_mca,abbrev=TRUE)
```

###<span style="color:purple">MCA dimensions</span>

**Dimdesc** function points out the variables and the categories that are the most characteristic according to each dimension obtained by a MCA, i.e. it aims to facilitate interpretations of the dimensions in allowing to see which variables the axes are the most linked to/ which categories describe the best each axis.  

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.align="center", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, warnings=FALSE}
dimdesc(res_mca,axes=1:2,proba=0.05)
```

###<span style="color:purple">Eigenvalues and scree plot</span>

The proportion of variances retained by the different dimensions (axes) can be extracted separately.

```{r fig.align="center", fig.height=8, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
eig.val <- get_eigenvalue(res_mca)
head(eig.val,n=10)
```

To visualize the percentage of inertia explained by each MCA dimension:
```{r echo=TRUE, fig.align="center", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
eig.val <- res_mca$eig
barplot(eig.val[, 2], 
        names.arg = 1:nrow(eig.val), 
        main = "Variances Explained by Dimensions (%)",
        xlab = "Principal Dimensions",
        ylab = "Percentage of variances",
        col ="steelblue")
# Add connected line segments to the plot
lines(x = 1:nrow(eig.val), eig.val[, 2], 
      type = "b", pch = 19, col = "red")
```

Eigenvalues can be used to determine the number of axes to retain. As to my knowledge, there is no "rule of thumb" to choose the number of dimensions to keep for the data interpretation. It depends on the research question and the researcher's need. The level of satisfaction, e.g.in case of 80% of the total variance explained the number of dimensions necessary to achieve that can be chosen.

The first two express 14% of the total dataset variance meaning that 14% of the individuals or variables total variability is explained by the plane. This is a very small percentage.In addition, there is no clear drop to help to identify how many dimensions should be included in the final interpretation to capture the right number of real information. Dimensions having low scores are likely to be unstable, too.
 

###<span style="color:purple">Graphical representation of individuals and variable categories</span>

To further clarify the MCA results graphical representation is used. Firstly, a biplot showing the global pattern within the data is created. Observations are represented by blue points and variables by red triangles and labels. The distance between any observation points or variable points gives a measure of their similarity (or dissimilarity). Similar types of individuals are close on the map, as well as similar kinds of variables.


```{r fig.align="center", fig.height=6, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
fviz_mca_biplot(res_mca, 
               repel = TRUE, # Avoid text overlapping (slow if many point)
               ggtheme = theme_minimal())
```



###<span style="color:purple">Graphical representation of variables</span>

Variable categories related results can be extracted separately to provide information for the coordinates, the cos2 and the contribution of variable categories:

-  var$coord: coordinates of variables to create a scatter plot

-  var$cos2: represents the quality of the representation for variables on the factor map.

-  var$contrib: contains the contributions (in percentage) of the variables to the definition of the dimensions.


Next, a plot is created to visualize the correlation between variables of the first and second dimension. Basically variable categories with a similar profile are grouped together.
Negatively correlated variable categories are positioned on opposite sides of the plot origin (opposed quadrants). The distance between category points and the origin measures the quality of the variable category on the factor map. Category points that are away from the origin are well represented on the factor map. Supplementary quantitative final grade variable is plotted blue.

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.height=6, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
fviz_mca_var(res_mca, choice = "mca.cor", 
            repel = TRUE, # Avoid text overlapping (slow)
            ggtheme = theme_minimal())
```

The plot should help to identify variables that are the most correlated with each dimension. The squared correlations between variables and the dimensions are used as coordinates.

It can be seen that, the variables mother큦 and father큦 education as well as father큦 job are the most correlated with dimension 1. Similarly, the variables going out with friends, high alcohol usage and class failures are the most correlated with dimension 2.

###<span style="color:purple">Variable contribution</span>

It's possible to change the color and the shape of the variable points as well as the number of top variables, i.e. the ones having the highest contribution.

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.height=6, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

fviz_mca_var(res_mca, col.var="black", shape.var = 15,
             repel = TRUE,select.var = list(contrib = 6))
```

It is also possible to control the transparency of variable categories according to their contribution values.

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.height=6, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Change the transparency by contrib values
fviz_mca_var(res_mca, alpha.var="contrib",
             repel = TRUE,
             ggtheme = theme_minimal())
```

The most contributing, i.e. important variable categories can be visualized by gradient-colouring them respect to their contribution value. Meaning basically, that low, medium and high contributions have different colours.

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.height=9, fig.width=13, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
fviz_mca_var(res_mca, col.var = "contrib",
             gradient.cols = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800", "#FC4E07"), 
             repel = TRUE, # avoid text overlapping (slow)
             ggtheme = theme_minimal()
             )
```

Simple bar plots can also be used to visualize contribution of variable categories. The top 12 variable categories contributing to the first and second dimension:

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.height=4, fig.width=4, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Contributions of rows to dimension 1
fviz_contrib(res_mca, choice = "var", axes = 1, top = 12)
# Contributions of rows to dimension 2
fviz_contrib(res_mca, choice = "var", axes = 2, top = 12)
```
The red dashed line indicates the expected average value, If the contributions were uniform. 


###<span style="color:purple">Variable cos2</span>

For cos2 values it is similarly possible to change the color and the shape of the variable points as well as the number of top variables, i.e. the ones having the highest cos2 values.
```{r echo=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.height=6, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

fviz_mca_var(res_mca, col.var="black", shape.var = 15,
             repel = TRUE,select.var = list(cos2 = 10))
```

If a variable category is well represented by two dimensions, the sum of the cos2 is closed to one. For some of the row items, more than 2 dimensions are required to perfectly represent the data.
Or it's  transparency of the variable categories according to their cos2 values can be controlled.

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.height=6, fig.width=10, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Change the transparency by cos2 values
fviz_mca_var(res_mca, alpha.var="cos2",
             repel = TRUE,
             ggtheme = theme_minimal(),selectMod="cos2 10")
```

Furthermore, just as with the contributions, variable categories can be gradient-coloured with respect to their cos2 value. Meaning that low, medium and high co2 values have different colours.

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.height=9, fig.width=13, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Color by cos2 values: quality on the factor map
fviz_mca_var(res_mca, col.var = "cos2",
             gradient.cols = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800", "#FC4E07"), 
             repel = TRUE, # Avoid text overlapping
             ggtheme = theme_minimal())
```



Similarly as with the contributions, it is also possible to create a bar plot of variable cos2 importance.

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.height=4, fig.width=4, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Cos2 of variable categories on Dim.1 and Dim.2
fviz_cos2(res_mca, n=10,choice = "var", axes = 1:2,top=12)
```


###<span style="color:purple">Grouped biplots</span>

Individuals can be coloured by groups and a concentration ellipse can be added around each group.

####<span style="color:purple">Grouped biplots:**Performance group**</span>
 

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.height=6, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# habillage = external grouping variable
fviz_mca_ind(res_mca, habillage = dfalc$OUT_SOW_mort_dic, addEllipses = TRUE)
```

####<span style="color:purple">Grouped biplots:**High alcohol**</span>

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.height=6, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# habillage = index of the column to be used as grouping variable
fviz_mca_ind(res_mca, habillage = dfalc$OUT_SOW_cull_dic, addEllipses = TRUE)
```

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.height=4, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
fviz_ellipses(res_mca, c("OUT_SOW_cull_dic", "OUT_SOW_mort_dic"),
              geom = "point")
```

```



```{r echo=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.height=6, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
res_mca$quanti
```



###<span style="color:purple">Summary of the first plane</span>

####<span style="color:purple">First dimension</span>

The first dimension aims to characterize individuals with a high positive coordinate on the axis (right) and with a high negative coordinate (left). 

Firstly, there are a group of individuals on the right with both mother and father having higher education, mother and father working as a teacher, no class failures and the best performance group. Additionally, they are sharing being active, young, having a mother work in health sector and having family support. On the contrary, there are low frequency scores for mother and father having only elementary level or no education, mother or father work as "other"" or mother being at home and having class failures as well as low frequencies for no activities, belonging to the lowest performance group category, average health group and no family support.

Secondly, there are a group of individuals on the left with class failures one or more, lowest performancegroup, no willingness to higher education, high alcohol consumption and the oldest age category. Additionally, to some extent common are mother having low educational level, going out with friends, mother work as other or have average level education as well as being a male. Low frecuencies are for no class failures, mother and father being high school educated, young age group, mother working as a teacher, best performance group, being a female and having father as a teacher.

Thirdly, there is a group on the left with mother and father having little education, health being average, gender female, low alcohol consumption, mother working at home and father as "other"", having a positive attitude towards high edution, performing at an almost average level and sometimes going out with friends. Low frequencies are there for mother큦 or father큦 higher education, mother working as a teacher, being a male, using alcohol, going out a lot, father being a teacher, health being very good, having no ideas about further education and haing some class failures. 

####<span style="color:purple">Second dimension</span>

The second dimension aims to characterize individuals with a high positive coordinate on the axis (top) and with a high negative coordinate (bottom). 

Firstly, there is a group up in the graph having in common one or more class failures, lowest performance group, negative attitude towards higher eduction, high alcohol consumption,
age above 17, father큦 low education, going out frequently, mother working as "other", mother큦 low education and being a male. Additionally, the group members  have low frequencies for no class failures, mother큦 and father큦 high education, positive attitude towards education, low alcohol consumption, being young, having mother in education, best performance group, being a female and having father in education.

Secondly, there is a group sharing high frequency for mother and father being highly educated, mother and father working as educators, no class failures, performing best, being active and young, mother working in the health sector having family support. In addition there is low frequency for mother큦 or father큦 low education, jobs as "other"", mother at home, one or more class failures, no activities, lowest performance group, average health and no family support.

Thirdly, there is a negative co-ordinate group sharing high frequency for the lowest level of education of the mother and the father, average health, being a female, low alcohol usage, mother being at home, father working as "other", performing middle low, rarely or never going out and having a positive attitude towards education. Low frequencies are common for high education for mother and father, mother being a teacher, being a male, using a lot of alcohol, going out frequently, father working as a teacher, best health group, no positive attitude towards education, one or more failures.

##<span style="color:purple">Conclusion</span>

The aim of this study was to scrutinize the multidimensional data into a more comprehensible, lower dimensional structure and to reveal some association between different types of respondents. However, the reduction was not completely suitably acchieved as the inertia explained was low and the observations were very scattered.
However, there is an indication that some sociodemographic factors have joint effects. It is important to confirm the associations using advanced techniques, e.g. by applying theory of planned behavior to study the relations among personal beliefs, attitudes, behavioral intentions and behaviour and other individual as well as parental features to investigate the risk factors for high alcohol usage. Future investigations need to be done to identify those variables that show significant relationships and to take them forward for further analysis.
